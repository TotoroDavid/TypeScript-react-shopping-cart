in the next project, I used ReactJS shopping cart with Typescript, Material UI, Styled Components, and React-Query
at the same time, I was using a free open API for dummy data to the items in the shop. React-Query hooks are used for fetching the data from the API.

Styled Components is used in combination with Material UI to customize the styles.
